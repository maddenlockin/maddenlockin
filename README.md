### About Me


I am a software engineer with a background in mental health and social services. I was the medical supervisor at a group home for queer teens and continue as a permanency connection and mentor for two of those kids. My background has filled my cup with soft-skills that make me the ultimate teammate. 

I am a person for people, first. I seek to understand what drives each person in order to help motivate and create cohesion. 
As a strongly empathic person, I will shift my own way of framing a situation in order to understand where a teammate is coming from. 
As an impeccably organized dev, I strive to keep my files structured in a straight-foward and navigable manner. For example, each SQL table having its own testing file.
I thrive in an environment where collaboration and connection drive ideation.
