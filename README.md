### About Me
I am a software engineer with a background in mental health and social services. I was the medical supervisor at a group home for queer teens and continue as a permanency connection and mentor for two of those kids. My background has filled my cup with soft-skills that make me the ultimate teammate. 
I am a person for people, first. I seek to understand what drives each person in order to help motivate and create cohesion. 
I am also strongly empathic; I will shift my own way of framing a situation in order to understand where a teammate is coming from. 
I am impeccably organized. I love when each item has its own place and each component has its own file. 
I thrive in an environment where collaboration and connection drive ideation.

I am looking to continue learning and sharpening skills as a developer at a socially focused company.
